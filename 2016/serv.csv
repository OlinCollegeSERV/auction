Location: I'll be traveling across the western US in 2017. I will not fly to meet you for our objective, as I'll be unemployed. However, with planning and the right objective, I can meet you there.
Gear: You may need to rent a few things depending on the objective. I have most gear.

Following Ramen adventures, we will waddle (or drive) to my apartment in Somerville and drink tea and eat pie; you choose what kind of pie. The Melmobile can provide transit to/from Olin if needed. Note that the Melmobile blasts classical music on the highway at volumes I can hear without my cochlear implant.

Bidding starts at $5 for a one-person ramen trip. At $10,  you can bring up to two people; at $15, up to three, and at $20, up to four (the most my car will hold). Bids above $20 will include additional surprises depending on the amount of the bid. For instance, other local alumni may make guest appearances; Mel's signing friends may descend upon the dinner and turn it into a voice-off ASL immersion dinner, Mel might spontaneously start cartooning everything, and so on.

By the way: if you have food preferences/needs, we can get super-creative. I have made and/or found pork-free, vegetarian, and gluten-free ramen in the past, as well as pie-like variants involving fruit and deliciousness. Ramen and pie and tea will happen in a way that works for everyone.",1,Students,
