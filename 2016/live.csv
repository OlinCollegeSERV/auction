Chef Peter makes magic out of food and food out of magic. He's worked at Aujourdâ€™hui at the Four Seasons, staged at Michelin-starred restaurants, TA'd for Jacques Pepin, and has been working towards this restaurant for more than 20 years. Everything that can be made in house, including things you didn't realize could be made in house (fermenting your own miso?), is made in house. Everything that can be harvested locally is harvested locally (where do you even find local wild flower foragers?). For the curious, the seating all gives a great view of the intricacies involved in preparing fine dining and the  chefs are more than happy to answer questions and explain techniques. But most importantly, the food the delicious and delightful and the whole experience is thought out down to the shape of the counter. You can read more about it in multiple Boston Globe reviews, Boston Magazine's Best of Boston, Eater, and other publications.
