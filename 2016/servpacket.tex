Everything that can be made in house, including things you didn't realize could be made in house (fermenting your own miso?), is made in house. Everything that can be harvested locally is harvested locally (where do you even find local wild flower foragers?). For the curious, the seating all gives a great view of the intricacies involved in preparing fine dining and the  chefs are more than happy to answer questions and explain techniques. But most importantly, the food the delicious and delightful and the whole experience is thought out down to the shape of the counter. You can read more about it in multiple Boston Globe reviews, Boston Magazine's Best of Boston, Eater, and other publications. It will be the best meal you eat this year, if not the best meal of your life.

\subsection{SERV Auction Copy Machine}

Starting Bid: \$1
\newline
Number of winners: 2
\newline
If you win this item for n dollars, and bid \textless 2n dollars on another item, I will do my best to copy that item as close as I can for you. This may be an exact replica, or something kinda close ish. The copy machine works better on some items than others. One copy per winner.

This item can totally be used as bid insurance (I.e. if you lose an item you still get it), flake insurance (I.e. if you win an item but they never follow through I will instead), or even just item duplication (I.e. you win an item and now you get two of it).

Well, tell you what: I'll send you a care package. I'll put in it something interesting that I find, or maybe just some stuff I have around that I haven't used in a while and want to get rid of. I may even write you a card making up a story about how it's your favorite. But no matter what, you'll get a care package. Unless the mail loses it or something.

If you're over 21, we can go to my favorite bar (Gestalt Haus) in Marin and I'll buy you a beer. I know a bunch of flat \& hilly routes, so we can do whatever you're comfortable with. Same deal with distance.

If bidding goes over \$50, you can bring a friend. 
If bidding goes over \$150, you can bring 2 friends. (I have a lot of bikes)
If bidding goes over \$250, we can go bike glamping (I'll rent a cabin at the Petaluma KOA) in Sonoma. Bring up to 4 of your friends, but some of them will have to bring their own bikes.

NOTE: This is probably best for people who are in the 5'2-6'0" range. I have 3 bikes that are suitable for 5'2-5'8"people, and somebody who's taller could borrow Mikey (Lintz, '11)'s bike.

Join us for some amazing food. Ask anyone who has eaten at our house... Jody is a fantastic cook and nobody leaves hungry.

On Thanksgiving day, I will pick you up (if you do not have a car) and bring you to our house in Acton for a GIANT meal. You will be an honorary member of my weird family for the day. We plan do some mad science, hiking in the trails behind our house (which has been known to devolve into a snow-ball fight) between courses and trivia Bingo with FABULOUS prizes!  As weather permits there may even be a camp-fire. I will drop you back at Olin in the evening.
\subsection{Inherit Our Ball Pit}
Haley Pelletier \& Anne LoVerso
\\
Starting Bid: \$20
\newline
Two years ago, Anne and Haley purchased 2000 plastic balls and a kiddie pool in which to put them. A ball pit was born. It has been a staple of their dorm rooms ever since, and brings great joy to all who enter it. Sadly, the pit will not be able to make the journey to post-grad life with Anne and Haley. They would instead like for it to become an Olin tradition -- an heirloom of sorts to hand down to progeny for years to come. In winning this item, you are inheriting all 2000 plastic balls and the kiddie pool in which they are contained. You are also agreeing to pass down the ball pit via the SERV auction before you graduate. You may pick it up from its home at any point during the Spring semester, be it the day classes resume or the day of graduation. Stop by EH429G to see the pit in all its colorful plastic glory, and decide if you are worthy.

If you're already a climber and you have your own climbing shoes, we'll take you on an outdoor climbing adventure to one of our favorite spots. We can provide the crash pad and snacks, plus transportation to and from Olin. Most importantly: if the bid reaches or surpasses \$100, I will sacrifice my remaining shreds of dignity and climb wearing a giant banana costume.

If you win this item, we’ll shoot you an email to check for any dietary restrictions/special requests and we’ll do our best to send you two awesome packages!
\subsection{Finally, Mitch Gives Something Good}
Mitch Cieminski
\\
Starting Bid: \$20
\newline
In the past, I've won some pretty excellent SERV auction items (like Geoff singing to Oscar whole wearing a speedo, dinner with Rob and Scott, lifetime FWOP tickets, Joshe expressing my opinion, etc). I've also given some pretty solid ones (especially the Needham Pizza Tour 2k16). 

This is an item that could be so much more than any of those. The winter of this item will get a special meeting with me, Mitch Cieminski, in which we discuss my abilities and your needs, and determine the perfect SERV suction item or experience for me to give to you. Then, some time later, you'll get that thing or experience. Sounds simple enough, right? But I personally guarantee that it will be the best SERV auction purchase that you make this year, and possibly ever. This is a big promise, but one that I'm committed to making happen.

The quality of the item will certainly scale with the amount donated. I'm willing to sink my own money into this. Group bids are welcome.
