I've identified all 13 subjects for the experiment.

Sweet Tomatoes
Kostas Pizza and Seafood
Domino's Pizza
Needham House of Pizza
Hearth Pizzeria
Comella's
Not Your Average Joe's
Cowlick's Deli
Nicholas' Pizzeria
Bertucci's
Town House of Pizza
Gianni's Pizza and Deli
Brothers Pizza and Restaurant

Experimental Method:
We go to Needham on a Saturday
We go to every restaurant on the list of subjects
At each restaurant, we split one (1) small pizza, half cheese, half ""house choice""
I WILL PURCHASE ALL PIZZAS
We compare cheese as a baseline
We compare ""house choice"" as a measure of each eatery's understanding of pizza as a comestible medium

Expected results:
We will be very full
We will know the best pizza in the town of Needham
Need there be anything else?

Experimenters can either be just you and me, or we can take along some friends if you'd rather do that. Split it however you want. I'm also willing to divide the experiment among multiple days (no more than 3 total days)."|Food

American Beef Jerky is decent, I guess, but a little sweet and kinda gross. Biltong is a bit thicker of meat cuts and usually a little moister with a whole bunch more flavor*. When given to Americans, one described it as ""like cool bacon"". So yeah. I can't promise you'll like it, but it is definitely my favorite food. If, by some catastrophe, you do regret this item, I will work with you to find a Biltong recipe you do like and remake it to your taste. 

I will start with 2 pounds of beef, but it'll be dried so it'll be less. 
If bidding goes over $70, I will double the amount of biltong or make it twice. 
I will need to make this when I am home for at least a week so it might take a few months to get it to you. I will either deliver or ship depending on what makes more sense. If you're in the area, you're welcome to come make it with me.  *One other important difference: Biltong is dried over a week, while Jerky is sometimes cooked at low heat. So, you're getting cured, raw, dried meat. I will not get it to you unless it is safe, but I wanted you to know that."|Food
