Rob Martello and Scott Hersey|robert.martello@olin.edu|The Scott and Rob Extravaganza|35|"Scott Hersey will become Olin’s newest professor on day one of the spring semester when he teaches his first Olin Chemistry course. Rob Martello has been at Olin since the olden days, when the college was operated out of glorified trailers and used acronyms such as WODTOD (ask Rob what this means). Scott starts nonprofit companies, studies urban air quality, explores the savannas of South Africa, surfs Steamer Lane without a leash, jogs through redwood forests, and strives to make each day a poetic testament to the sublime power of the human spirit. Rob watches Star Wars and listens to 80s music. Clearly, you need to spend time with these two iconic professors… and now you can.

The winning bidders will experience a bona fide Scott and Rob extravaganza. The nature and magnitude of this extravaganza depend upon the size of your donation, so this is a time to dig deep.

  Bids up to $75 will earn you a spirited on-campus activity that will stretch your minds.  We will find a location in the residence halls or AC that is conducive to snacks, music, a fun game or two, and a stimulating discussion of a topic (perhaps a book or movie discussion, or planning some new enterprise) that you help select.

·         Bids from $75 to $200 will kick things up a notch.  We can still meet on campus if you like, or we can identify a nearby setting such as Walden Pond or a museum that will give us more to discuss and more to do.  The food and beverages are getting more elaborate and more interesting at this level, and we can consider a picnic or an all-out ice cream bash.  And Scott and Rob can reach out to another faculty member of your choice, to multiply the good times.

·         Bids over $200 qualify for the “big kahuna” package.  Welcome to the big leagues, my generous friend.  Would you like to experience a South African brai (BBQ) with a festival of meats grilled to perfection and all the fixins?  At this level we also need some epic entertainment… perhaps a guided tour of the Freedom Trail with a history buff who is practically a fixture at the Revere house?  We will modify the plan if you have other ideas, and we are happy to invite a group of other Olin Professors to join the fun if you believe that more’s the merrier. Please note that for every $20 you bid above $200 we will add another exciting twist to this already ridiculous package.

Gather some friends and pool your resources. You do not want to miss this one!"|Events
Shane Skikne|Shane.skikne@students.olin.edu|.01% of my annual salary for life|20|"Every year, I will either give you .01% of my annual salary OR give you a gift worth .015% of my annual salary OR spend .02% of my annual salary on the 2 of us doing something together. My choice. 
To put it in perspective, .02% of a $75,000 salary is $15. So odds are, you'll get a lunch out of this annually, but if I ever strike it big, you're going to be very happy you own this item. 

*I'll add that I need to generally know who you are for this to happen. Bonus points if I like you. My annual salary is what I earn from my main job's salary, bonuses, and any exercised stock options. This does not include side work or any income from investing or anything else. Any time after 5 years, I can buy you out for .05% of my annual salary. This is not a legal contract. I won't be a jerk and by winning this, you're agreeing not to be a jerk either.* "|Miscellaneous

mark somerville|mark.somerville@olin.edu|Dinner at Mark's House|50|"You like food.
You like food that is not dining hall food.
Mark likes to cook food.  He also has a real stove and a real kitchen and a real dining room.
Kris Groth also likes to cook food, and Mark thinks he can harass Kris into coming to his house and cooking with him.  Kris worked the line at Craigie on Main, and made his own sous vide machine. 

Copious courses of culinary creations await your bid.  We (by which I mean Mark) thinks that Kris will want to cook at *least* four courses, if not more.

And if Kris bags, Mark will cook instead.  It won't be *as* good, but it will still be ok..."|Events

THE TRIUMVIRATE OF SHADOWS|TRIUMVIRATE.OF.SHADOWS@gmail.com|Help design the largest treasure hunt Olin has ever seen|20|"At last year's SERV auction, an item appeared, promising to create a treasure hunt for the winner with scope proportional to the size of the winning bid. The item sold for over a thousand dollars, beginning a hunt that is global in scale.  Packages have already been hidden in twenty states and over a dozen countries around the world. The puzzles leading to each package are difficult enough that only TWO have been solved in the first year of the hunt.  The hunt is administrated by the mysterious and reclusive TRIUMVIRATE OF SHADOWS.  A number of Oliners are already part of the team trying to solve the hunt.  Now is your chance to join the Dark Side.   

At $20, choose one: 
-Either: you will be mailed a tiny package to hide anywhere in the world, any time in the next two years, and the package will become one of destinations on the treasure hunt, 
-OR: design a puzzle, as intricate and difficult you want, that leads to one of the existing packages. 

At $40: You can hide a package AND design the puzzle that leads to it.

At $75: You will receive two packages and (if you want) can design up to two puzzles.

At $100: You will receive three packages and can design up to three puzzles.

Each $25 over $100: receive one additional package and design up to one additional clue.

At $250: You can have up to 10 packages--as many as you have interesting places to hide them.  You can design as many puzzles as you feel you have time for.

At $500, THE TRIUMVIRATE will become THE QUADRUMVIRATE.  You will be become a full member of the mysterious group who administrates the treasure hunt, will be included on all communication, and will have an equal share of authority.

TO THE TEAM CURRENTLY WORKING ON THE TREASURE HUNT: 
WE ARE MONITORING YOU AND YOUR COMMUNICATIONS. *ANY* ATTEMPT TO USE THIS ITEM TO CHEAT OR GAIN AN ADVANTAGE IN ANY WAY WILL RESULT IN THE IMMEDIATE TERMINATION OF THE ENTIRE TREASURE HUNT. OUR AGENTS ARE LEGION. ONE MAY EVEN HAVE INFILTRATED YOUR RANKS. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED."|Miscellaneous
