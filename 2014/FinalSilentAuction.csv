Adam Coppola, Michael Resnick, Luke Morris and Brett Atkinson|brett.atkinson@students.olin.edu|A Evening In Paris|10|%Picture it: You are in Paris. That’s right, Paris, France. You know, the one in Europe? Yeah, you know. Anyway, as I was saying, you and your significant other/best friend/etc are in Paris, sitting outside along the Seine, eating the best meal you've ever had. What are you eating, you ask? I don’t know, French food probably. Don’t worry about it. Back to my story (again), you two are sitting by the river, eating delicious food, oh, and did I mention the music? You are being serenaded by the finest pianist in the city, and his beautiful music floats through the air all around you, another layer of the magical ambiance of the place. You haven’t heard of this pianist before? Clearly you don’t appreciate art. Where was I? Ah, yes, Paris, food, music, what else… Oh yes! The beverages! They’re great. No, I’m not going to tell you anymore about them. Are you finished interrupting me? Finally, you look around at the tables closest to you, and who do you see but your two best friend-couples! They’re in Paris also! Crazy. 
 
But wait – none of us are actually in France, because France is expensive and we’re college students. But we have the next best thing for you! We are bringing Paris to three lucky pairs, right here at Olin. Hosted by Chez Coppola, Chez Morri, Monsieur Resnitsky, and Monsieur Brette, three couples (that’s six people total, in case you weren't sure) will have a wonderful evening of food, beverage, music, and company on a three way date night (or not-date, which ever you prefer) before winter break. Bid as a couple, and the top three get to partake in this once-in-a-lifetime* experience!

Jackie Rose|jacqueline.rose32@gmail.com|Help you find an apartment in San Francisco!|25|%Are you planning on living in SF this summer or at some other point in the next year? Are you worried about finding a place to live? You should be! Fortunately, I can help by looking at apartments for you while you're still in Boston. Of course, looking at apartments is a rather time-consuming job, so I offer the graduated scale below:

$25 will get you an apartment visit.
$50 will get you two apartment visits!
$75 will get you three whole apartment visits!
$100 will get you four apartments visits!

And, simply because it's fun to dream, for $500 I will go on unlimited apartment visits during the space of one month, and even help you look on Craigslist, Padmapper, Trulia, and whatever other websites exist.

Caveats:
This is limited to San Francisco and the Peninsula, within 10 miles of a BART or Caltrain station.
I need at least 48 hours' notice to look at anything on a weekday and five days' notice to look at anything on a weekend. I will not reschedule any personal obligations to visit a location. I also work full-time and will not miss work to visit somewhere.
This is not a guarantee that I will find you something, only that I will assist you in looking. Even the $500 option is not a guarantee of anything, only that I will try my best to find you somewhere. (But my best is pretty darn awesome, so you'll probably get something).
You will need to find the places for me to visit. I will not be trawling craigslist or padmapper for you unless you go for the $500 option.%|Miscellaneous|

Jackie Rose|jacqueline.rose32@gmail.com|Guide and Map to San Francisco Neighborhoods|20|%Do you want to live in San Francisco? Are you confused because there are somewhere between 36 (officially recognized) and 119 (listed on Wikipedia) neighborhoods in San Francisco? Are you worried about finding the right place to live in the city? Well, you're in luck! This auction item is offering (on a graduated scale) a guide to the San Francisco neighborhoods, that guide in a sortable spreadsheet, and a map of the city.

The guide will include name; nickname; location on a map; median and average cost of rent for studios, single bedroom, and per bedroom in larger apartments (where data is available, estimated when it is not); brief history (when available); notable landmarks or parks; highest-ranked bars according to Yelp; a very stereotyped description of the average person living in the neighborhood (if indeed there is a typical person); and various other interesting data. There may even be pictures.

The guide spreadsheet will take data about each neighborhood and place it in a sortable spreadsheet, so that you can easily find which neighborhoods are the most expensive, which neighborhoods are the highest (in elevation or otherwise), or which neighborhoods have the most human feces on the street (where data is available).

The map will be colored according to travel time (by walking, biking, or MUNI) to nearest tech bus stop or public transit (Bart or Caltrain) station of your choice. 

The graduated scale:
$20 gets you the guide and spreadsheet.
$25 gets you the guide and spreadsheet OR a digital copy of the map.
$35 gets you the guide, spreadsheet, and a digital copy of the map.
$50 gets you the guide, spreadsheet, and a physical copy of the map.%|Miscellaneous|
