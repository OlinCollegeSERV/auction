Sometime next semester (of mutual availability), I will spend a weekend (during which I will sleep) making a game based on a concept you provide. I'll work with you (and, optionally, a team of your choice) to refine the concept into something of appropriate scope and good gameplay. I reserve the right to veto game ideas (in particular, I won't make anything that involves alcohol or that I consider too offensive). We will both own the IP.

My creds

I make games. A lot. I'm currently doing a Capstone in Narrative Games and an IS in experimental game design. I currently make at least one new game every two weeks. I frequently attend hackathons and game jams.
